      <h2>Narrative Recap: The Defensive Masterpiece</h2>
      <p>
        The atmosphere for the rivalry game at Hard Rock Stadium was electric, but the <strong>Miami defense</strong> quickly silenced the Gators, delivering a performance for the ages. The Hurricanes held Florida to a paltry 141 total yards, completely dictating the flow of the game. Miami's offense was methodical, scoring <strong>three touchdowns and two field goals</strong> to build a dominant lead, relying heavily on a physical ground attack. Crucially, their 50% conversion rate on 3rd down kept drives alive, while the defense's perfect shutout on Florida's 3rd-down attempts (0/13) secured the convincing <strong>26-7</strong> victory over their in-state rival.

      <p>
        The <strong>Defensive Line</strong> was the star, limiting Florida to just 141 total yards and a shocking 0% conversion rate on 3rd down. This dominance allowed Miami's offense to win with a physical run game. <strong>Mark Fletcher Jr.</strong> was the workhorse, chewing up clock and yards, while the dual-threat of Fletcher and <strong>CharMar Brown</strong> (responsible for a game-sealing TD) wore down the Gator defense. The Gators' passing attack, led by <strong>Carson Beck</strong>, struggled immensely, failing to find consistency and throwing a critical interception that highlighted the stifling pressure by the Hurricanes' secondary.

      <h2>The Final Takeaway: Season Impact</h2>
      <p class="impact-conclusion">
        This convincing win over the Gators is a <strong>statement victory</strong> for the Hurricanes' program, built on the back of an absolutely elite defensive performance and a relentless rushing attack. Holding a rival to 141 yards and 0% on third downs is a generational effort. The Hurricanes' ability to physically dominate the line of scrimmage offensively and defensively shows they are built for the long haul. This result confirms Miami's status as a top contender and provides tremendous momentum heading into their conference schedule. They have established themselves as the team to beat in the state, with the defense proving they can travel deep into the season.
